SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```

## Business Context
```
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
